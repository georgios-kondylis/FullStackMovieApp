# Project Presentation – Netflix-Style Streaming Platform

Hi everyone, my name’s Georgios, and I’m a full-stack web developer. Today I want to walk you through one of my biggest projects — a Netflix-style streaming platform that I built completely from scratch.

This isn’t just a simple clone. My goal was to create a secure, dynamic, and highly interactive platform that feels professional and production-ready. I wanted to showcase my ability to build a complex application end-to-end, from the backend API architecture all the way to the polished, responsive user interface. The stack I used includes React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and REST APIs, which gave me a powerful and scalable foundation.

Let’s start with authentication, because security is at the heart of this project. The platform uses JWT authentication to handle user sessions securely. I added a guest mode, so people can browse content without logging in, but they can’t like, dislike, bookmark, or manage accounts. For signed-in users, the app creates a three-hour token-based session, and if they choose the ‘Remember Me’ option, their session and selected profile are stored in local storage so they can jump straight back in later. I also implemented protected routes, so only authenticated users can access certain areas of the app.

From there, I built a flexible profile management system. A user can create multiple profiles, each with its own name and profile picture. There’s also a Kids Mode toggle, which filters out adult content and removes certain genres like horror or thriller. All of this is driven by my own REST API endpoints with full CRUD functionality, and profile data is stored in MongoDB so it persists across sessions. The Kids Mode itself works by dynamically filtering data coming from the TMDB API before it even reaches the UI, ensuring restricted content is never displayed.

Speaking of content, all of the movie and series data comes from the TMDB, including ratings, genres, and overviews, plus trailer keys. I then make a second call to the YouTube API to pull in the trailers and play them directly within the platform. This meant handling multiple APIs, managing asynchronous data, dealing with loading states, and setting up error handling and fallbacks so the user experience stays smooth even if an API response is slow.

One of the most important parts of a streaming platform is search and filtering. In my app, the search bar is global and always available in the navbar. If a user types something in, it dynamically searches TMDB for matching results. If they don’t, it defaults to showing trending content for both movies and series. They can also filter by genre, or even region when it come to  animated serries, with filters for Japanese or American animation. All of these filters are stored in React Context so they work instantly across the entire app without prop drilling.

To make sure the app’s state is consistent and easy to manage, I wrapped everything in a global provider using React Context API. This centralized state management makes it easier to maintain and keeps the codebase clean. On the UI side, I used Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness, added skeleton loaders so the interface feels smooth while content is loading, and built dynamic backgrounds that change based on the currently selected movie. I also created dropdown menus that give users quick access to favourites, watchlists, and profile details.

Interacting with content is just as important as displaying it. On any movie or series detail page, a user can like, dislike, or add it to their favourites. These actions are saved instantly to their active profile and stored in MongoDB, so they’re always there when the user comes back. This required real-time state updates and syncing with the backend to make sure the data is always accurate.

Now, let’s talk about the backend. It’s built with Node.js and Express, serving as the bridge between the frontend and MongoDB. I implemented authentication routes for login, guest access, and token validation; profile management endpoints; interaction endpoints for likes, dislikes, and favourites; and the Kids Mode filtering logic. On top of that, I added security measures like JWT token validation middleware, rate limiting, and CORS configuration.

On the frontend, React with TypeScript allowed me to maintain type safety and avoid common runtime errors. I designed it with reusable components, set up React Router for navigation and protected routes, and made sure the layout is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop. For animations, I used lightweight libraries so transitions are smooth but performance stays high.

Looking ahead, one of my next goals for the platform is to add an AI Movie Buddy — a chatbot that can recommend films based on mood or genre, help users discover hidden gems, or just chat about movies. This will involve integrating an LLM API and building a smart recommendation system.

This project demonstrates a wide range of my skills: on the frontend, working with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Context API, and responsive UI; on the backend, building APIs with Node.js and Express, handling authentication and middleware; managing MongoDB with well-designed schemas and optimized queries; integrating multiple APIs like TMDB and YouTube; implementing security best practices; optimizing performance with techniques like lazy loading and skeleton loaders; and creating a polished UI/UX that feels professional and user-focused.

So that’s my Netflix-style streaming platform. It’s secure, scalable, and full of features you’d expect in a real-world product, and it’s a project I’m proud to share because it reflects exactly what I can bring to a development team.
